## 3. Model intro

I proposed the method of predicting a future day's receipts number based on the past few (30 in my code) days. For the samll volume of data, I choose a linear model - Ridge Regression over deep learning/ neural networks like LSTM (a simple model usually exhibits better performance over deep neural networks when data volume is relatively small). Before building up my model, I choose to read and pre-process the data, including adding a data normalization step to maintain the data value within a common scale (10^6-10^7 is too large). As the optimization method, SGD + momentum helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging (this is crucial when tuning the hyperparameters which requires high amount of computation). Beside that, I also observed that a good memory locality (where the variableâ€™s memory accesses are more predictable, i.e. avoids memory allocation in the running of program by pre-allocating memories ahead) could improve performance of SGD. In this project, Bayesian Optimization is adapted for hyperparameter tuning for its efficiency over grid search/ random search (instead of painstakingly trying every hyperparameter set or testing hyperparameter sets at random, the Bayesian optimization method can converge to the optimal hyperparameters. Thus, the best hyperparameters can be obtained without exploring the entire sample space).

## 4. How to run this app?

### i. Run docker in command line

Run commands below in command line to lauch the app (make sure you're under the directory of ml-web-app):
```bash
docker build -t app-name .

docker run -p 80:80 app-name
```
Then open your web browser at your local host port http://0.0.0.0:80/docs. Press the "Try it out" icon under the POST tab and replace the "string" with the month of 2022 you're looking for.

By hitting the execute icon you'll get the estimated number of the scanned receipts for the month you specified at the 	
response body.

### ii. Send POST request through Postman (Recommended)

First you need to signup with Postman (https://www.postman.com/), then create a new request. Select the POST request and paste the link (https://ml-web-app.herokuapp.com/predict) to the webpage. Then select "Body" tab below and enter the request body in JSON format. Finally, you will get the result by hitting "Send" icon.
